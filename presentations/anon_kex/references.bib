  abstract = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication systems are currently being prepared for real-world deployment, but they face strong opposition over privacy concerns. Position beacon messages are the main culprit, being broadcast in cleartext and pseudonymously signed up to 10 times per second. So far, no practical solutions have been proposed to en- crypt or anonymously authenticate V2V messages. We propose two cryptographic innovations that enhance the privacy of V2V communication. As a core contribution, we introduce zone-encryption schemes, where vehicles generate and authentically distribute encryption keys associated to static geographic zones close to their location. Zone encryption provides security against eavesdropping, and, combined with a suitable anonymous authentication scheme, ensures that messages can only be sent by genuine vehicles, while adding only 224 Bytes of cryptographic overhead to each message. Our second contribution is an authentication mechanism fine-tuned to the needs of V2V which allows vehicles to authentically distribute keys, and is called dynamic group signatures with attributes. Our instantiation features unlimited locally generated pseudonyms, negligible credential download-and-storage costs, identity recovery by a trusted authority, and compact signatures of 216 Bytes at a 128-bit security level.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel use of pairing-based cryptography to improve circuit construction in onion routing anonymity networks. Instead of iteratively and interactively constructing circuits with a telescoping method, our approach builds a circuit with a single pass. The cornerstone of the improved protocol is a new pairing-based privacypreserving non-interactive key exchange. Compared to previous singlepass designs, our algorithm provides practical forward secrecy and leads to a reduction in the required amount of authenticated directory information. In addition, it requires significantly less computation and communication than the telescoping mechanism used by Tor. These properties suggest that pairing-based onion routing is a practical way to allow anonymity networks to scale gracefully.},

  abstract = {In a Collaborative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS), vehicles send collaborative awareness messages (CAMs) carrying information such as speed, position, and identity, to interact with other vehicles and to obtain transportation services. Traditionally, CAMs are broadcasted in plaintext over unsafe networks, which may leak sensitive information of the vehicle. On one hand, many existing works attempting to solve this problem focused on anonymous authentication, but ignored the confidentiality of CAMs. Conversely, some other attempts trying to keep the privacy of CAMs have backward security problems in key management or vehicle revocation. Therefore, in this paper, we present a practical privacy-preserving communication scheme for CAMs in C-ITS. To ensure the privacy of a vehicle's identity, our scheme mainly uses the re-randomizable PS signature method to realize anonymous authentication; and to meet backward security, we use the complete subtree method to realize both key management and vehicle revocation. In more details, our proposal fulfills more security and privacy requirements, such as correctness, anonymity, traceability, revocability, backward security and anti-illegal message dissemination, while also hiding the content of CAMs.},
